# Antymology: Evolutionary Ant Colony

## Project Overview

Antymology is a voxel-based simulation where a colony of ants evolves simple behaviors to build the largest nest possible. The world is procedurally generated, ants must obey terrain and health constraints, and a singular queen converts her health into nest blocks. Each generation evaluates performance and breeds a new population with mutation, creating visible improvement over time.

## Getting Started

### How To Run

1. Open the project in Unity 6000.3.\* and load SampleScene.
2. Press Play.
3. Watch the HUD for generation, time remaining, living ants, and nest blocks.

### Controls

- Fly camera: `WASD` to move, `Q/E` to move vertically.
- Rotate camera: middle mouse button + drag.

## Ant Behavior & Rules

- Health decreases every tick; ants die at 0 health and are removed.
- Mulch is consumed only when an ant is directly above it, and only if no other ant shares the cell.
- Ants may dig the block below them (never container blocks) and move into the dug space.
- Movement is limited to a maximum height difference of 2 between positions.
- Acidic blocks double the health drain rate.
- Ants may share health with another ant in the same cell (zero-sum transfer).
- A single queen builds nest blocks at the cost of 1/3 her max health.

### Evolutionary Algorithm

Each worker ant has a weighted genome that biases movement, digging, consuming, and sharing. At the end of each generation:

1. Workers are ranked by fitness (health + mulch consumed).
2. The top performers are kept as elites.
3. New genomes are created by crossover and mutation.
   This creates simple but observable evolutionary improvement without hand-authored behavior scripts.

## Configuration

Tune the simulation in [Assets/Components/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs](Assets/Components/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs):

- `WorkerCount`, `WorkerMaxHealth`, `QueenMaxHealth`
- `HealthDrainPerTick`, `MulchHealthGain`, `TickInterval`, `EvaluationDuration`
- `EliteCount`, `MutationRate`, `MutationMagnitude`
- `PheromoneDeposit`, `PheromoneDecay`, `PheromoneBias`

### Diffusion Analysis

After adding pheromone diffusion logic, the fitness level increased more rapidly and mulch consumption also rose. However, this change did not significantly impact the number of nest blocks per generation. This is likely due to the randomness of the queen's spawn location—if the queen is placed on an acidic or container block, she may die quickly, limiting nest block growth regardless of improved worker behavior.

## Technical Details

### Fitness Calculation

Fitness is used to rank ants at the end of each generation. For workers, fitness is:
fitness = health + (mulch consumed × 2)
For the queen, fitness is:
fitness = health + (mulch consumed × 2) + (nest built × 12)
This incentivizes nest building and mulch consumption. The calculation is implemented in [AntAgent.cs](Assets/Components/Agents/AntAgent.cs#L302-L307) and [ConfigurationManager.cs](Assets/Components/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs#L109-L116).

### Genome and Evolution

Each worker ant has a genome consisting of weights for movement, digging, consuming, and sharing. These weights bias the ant's actions. At the end of each generation:

- Ants are ranked by fitness.
- The top N are kept as elites (no mutation).
- The rest are generated by crossover (randomly mixing parent genomes) and mutation (randomly perturbing weights).
  Mutation rate and magnitude are configurable in [ConfigurationManager.cs](Assets/Components/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs).

### Movement and Pheromone Bias

Ants choose their next move based on genome weights and local pheromone concentration. The movement weight is scaled:
w' = w × (1 + p × 1.2)
Where w is the genome weight, p is the pheromone value. Queens follow nest pheromone, workers follow food pheromone. See [AntAgent.cs](Assets/Components/Agents/AntAgent.cs#L245-L255).
Movement is restricted to a max height difference of 2 between positions. Terrain constraints are checked in [CustomMath.cs](Assets/Helpers/CustomMath.cs).

### Pheromone Logic and Diffusion

Ants deposit pheromone each tick (up to 2.5 per cell). Air blocks decay pheromone by 0.05 per tick. Diffusion is implemented by blending each cell's pheromone with its neighbors, creating gradients ants can follow. This is handled in [AirBlock.cs](Assets/Components/Terrain/Blocks/AirBlock.cs#L81-L100).
Pheromone types:

- Food pheromone: guides workers to mulch.
- Nest pheromone: guides queen to build nest blocks.

### Health and Mulch

Health drains every tick. Mulch restores health when consumed. Acidic blocks double the health drain rate. Mulch can only be consumed if no other ant shares the cell. Health transfer between ants is zero-sum and only possible if they share a cell.

### Queen Logic

There is only one queen per generation. She builds nest blocks at the cost of 1/3 her max health. If her health reaches zero, she dies and cannot build further. Queen logic is implemented in [AntAgent.cs](Assets/Components/Agents/AntAgent.cs).

### Block Types and Colors

Block types include stone, grass, mulch, acidic, nest, and container. Each type is mapped to a tilemap coordinate and color in the relevant block scripts:

- [StoneBlock.cs](Assets/Components/Terrain/Blocks/StoneBlock.cs#L13-L31)
- [GrassBlock.cs](Assets/Components/Terrain/Blocks/GrassBlock.cs#L13-L31)
- [MulchBlock.cs](Assets/Components/Terrain/Blocks/MulchBlock.cs#L13-L31)
- [AcidicBlock.cs](Assets/Components/Terrain/Blocks/AcidicBlock.cs#L13-L31)
- [NestBlock.cs](Assets/Components/Terrain/Blocks/NestBlock.cs#L13-L31)
- [ContainerBlock.cs](Assets/Components/Terrain/Blocks/ContainerBlock.cs#L10-L31)

### Procedural Terrain Generation

The world is generated procedurally using noise functions. Terrain generation and block placement are handled in [NoiseGenerator.cs](Assets/Helpers/NoiseGenerator.cs). Terrain constraints (height, block types) are enforced during ant movement and digging.

### Simulation Timing and Evaluation

Simulation runs in ticks, controlled by `TickInterval` and `EvaluationDuration` in [ConfigurationManager.cs](Assets/Components/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs). At the end of each evaluation, ants are ranked, and the next generation is bred.

### Data Logging and TensorBoard

Simulation metrics (health, fitness, nest blocks, etc.) are logged to CSV files. The helper script [tensorboard_log.py](tools/tensorboard_log.py) streams these metrics into TensorBoard for visualization. Metrics are written to per-run folders under the Unity persistent data path.

### UI and Controls

The HUD displays generation, time remaining, living ants, and nest blocks. Camera controls are implemented for fly and rotate modes. UI logic is handled in [UI](Assets/Components/UI).

## Data Logging & Visualization: TensorBoard Streaming

To help analyze and visualize the simulation's performance and evolutionary progress, Antymology logs key metrics (such as health, fitness, and nest blocks) to CSV files during each run. These metrics can be streamed and visualized in TensorBoard, providing insight into how the colony evolves over time and how changes in configuration or logic affect outcomes.

The logging and streaming workflow is tightly integrated with the technical systems described above. For example, fitness calculations, health changes, and nest block counts are all tracked and exported for review. This allows for both debugging and deeper analysis of the evolutionary algorithm and ant behaviors.

### How to Stream Metrics into TensorBoard

1. **Run the simulation**
   - Start the Unity scene. Metrics are written to a per-run folder under the Unity persistent data path:
     C:\Users\Angie\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\Antymology\metrics\run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
   - You should see:
     - `health_metrics.csv`
     - `generation_metrics.csv`

2. **Stream metrics into TensorBoard**
   - Choose one of the commands below:

   **Option A: Full paths (run from anywhere)**

   ```bash
   python "C:\Users\Angie\Downloads\CPSC565-A3-FORK\Antymology\tools\tensorboard_log.py" --metrics-dir "C:\Users\Angie\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\Antymology\metrics" --logdir "C:\Users\Angie\Downloads\CPSC565-A3-FORK\Antymology\tb_logs" --follow
   ```

   **Option B: Run from the project root with a named run**

   ```bash
   python tools\tensorboard_log.py --metrics-dir "C:\Users\Angie\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\Antymology\metrics" --logdir "tb_logs\run_final" --follow
   ```

3. **Launch TensorBoard**
   - In another terminal:
   ```bash
   tensorboard --logdir "C:\Users\Angie\Downloads\CPSC565-A3-FORK\Antymology\tb_logs"
   ```

   - Then open: http://localhost:6006/

#### Notes

- If you run TensorBoard from the project root, you can use `tensorboard --logdir tb_logs` instead.
- The metrics folder keeps a `latest.txt` pointer, so you can pass the root `metrics` folder and it will use the newest run automatically.
- The run name shows as `.` when logs are written directly into the root logdir; using a subfolder (as in Option B) gives a nicer name.
- Stop streaming with Ctrl+C.
